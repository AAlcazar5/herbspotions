          </h2>
          <p className="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
            Consumers residing in California are afforded certain additional
            rights with respect to their personal information under the California
            Consumer Privacy Act or &quot;CCPA&quot; (California Civil Code
            Section 1798.100 et seq). If you are a California resident, this
            section applies to you. Collection and Use of Personal Information: In
            the preceding 12 months, we have collected the following categories of
            personal information: identifiers, information subject to Cal. Civ.
            Code § 1798.80(e), characteristics of protected classifications under
            California or U.S. law, commercial information, Internet or other
            electronic network activity information, geolocation data,
            professional or employment-related information, audio, electronic,
            visual or similar information, inferences drawn about you and other
            categories of personal information that relate to, describe or are
            reasonably capable of being associated with you. For examples of the
            precise data points we collect and the sources from which we collect
            this personal information, please see &quot;Collection of
            Information&quot; above. We collect personal information for the
            business and commercial purposes described in &quot;Use of
            Information&quot; above. Disclosure of Personal Information: We may
            share your personal information with third parties as described in the
            &quot;Sharing of Information&quot; section above. In the preceding 12
            months, we have disclosed the following categories of personal
            information for business or commercial purposes to the following
            categories of recipients: Categories of Third Parties Categories of
            Personal Information Disclosed for a Business or Commercial Purpose
            Vendors, consultants and other service providers who perform services
            on our behalf Identifiers Information subject to Cal. Civ. Code §
            1798.80 Commercial information Internet or other electronic network
            activity information Geolocation data Inferences Sale of Personal
            Information: California law requires that we provide transparency
            about personal information we &quot;sell,&quot; which for the purposes
            of the CCPA broadly means scenarios in which we have shared personal
            information with partners in exchange for valuable consideration.
            While we do not provide personal information about you to other
            companies for money, we do allow our advertising partners to collect
            identifiers, commercial information and Internet or other electronic
            network activity information via our Services to show you ads that are
            targeted to your interests. To opt out of having your personal
            information used for targeted advertising purposes, please see the
            “Advertising and Analytics” section above. You can also visit our
            &quot;California Do Not Sell My Personal Information&quot; webpage to
            make an opt-out request. Your Rights: Subject to certain limitations,
            you have the right to request (1) more information about the
            categories and specific pieces of personal information we have
            collected, used, sold and disclosed about you, (2) deletion of your
            personal information, and (3) that we stop selling your
            personal information. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your
            rights under the CCPA. You may make these requests by calling
            1-866-467-8688 and entering service code 358# or visiting this page.
            Once we receive your request, we will verify it by asking you to
            provide certain information, such as identifiers like your email
            address and phone number. If you would like to use an authorized agent
            registered with the California Secretary of State to exercise your
            rights, we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with
            power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written
            authority to submit requests on behalf of behalf. Notice of Financial
            Incentives: We offer various financial incentives. For example, we may
            provide discounts, coupons and other benefits for customers who sign
            up to receive our marketing emails or join our loyalty program. When
            you participate in a financial incentive, we collect personal
            information from you, such as identifiers (like your name and email
            address) and commercial information (like your purchase history). You
            can opt into a financial incentive by following the sign-up or
            participation instructions provided, and you have the ability to
            opt-out of the financial incentive, or our subsequent use of your
            personal information in connection with a financial incentive, at any
            time by contacting us at herbspotions1@gmail.com. In some cases, we
            may provide additional terms and conditions for a financial incentive,
            which we will present to you when you sign up. The value of your
            personal information is reasonably related to the value of the offer
            or discount presented to you.
